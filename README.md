# WebMediaUtil (v1.0.0)

`WebMediaUtil` is a high-performance, completely headless, standalone subprocess utility designed to extract `.m3u8` links (HLS streams) from web pages. 

By leveraging a single persistent Chromium/Chrome browser running a custom capture extension, it routes multiple scraper requests concurrently inside separate tabs. This approach avoids the 2–4 second startup/teardown overhead of spinning up browser processes per scrape request, leading to much faster extraction times and higher overall performance.

---

## Key Features
- **Persistent Headless Browser**: A single browser instance runs continuously in the background. If the process is terminated or crashes, the Go daemon automatically restarts it within one second.
- **Concurrent Tab Scrapers**: Requests are processed concurrently in separate tabs of the persistent browser. Tab popup protection, tab-specific header rewrites (e.g. User-Agents), and safety watchdog timers are managed on a per-tab basis.
- **Zero External Dependencies**: Implemented entirely using the Go Standard Library (no third-party CDP packages like `chromedp` or `playwright`).
- **Dynamic Port Collision Increment**: If the default port is in use, `WebMediaUtil` increments the port number and retries until a free port is successfully bound. It outputs the finalized port to stdout (`PORT_BOUND: :<port>`) so that the parent process can immediately read and connect.
- **Process Watchdog**: Monitors the parent process PID and automatically shuts down if the parent becomes unavailable. (Disabled if launched without a parent process, i.e., system PID <= 4).
- **Embedded Turnstile & Autoplay Solvers**: Emulates mouse events to solve Cloudflare Turnstile checkboxes and triggers HTML5 video players automatically.

## Build & Installation

Ensure you have [Go](https://go.dev/) (v1.26+) installed.

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd MediaUtil

# Build the executable
go build -o webmediautil.exe
```

---

## CLI Configuration Flags

```bash
Usage of webmediautil:
  -browser string
        Override browser executable path (e.g., path to chrome.exe / msedge.exe)
  -disable-watchdog
        Disable parent process watchdog
  -headless
        Run browser headless (always true for this repo, defaults to true)
  -max-tabs int
        Max concurrent browser tabs (default 5)
  -port string
        HTTP listen address (default ":8080")
  -timeout duration
        Per-request timeout (default 2m0s)
  -version
        Print version and exit
```

On startup, if `-browser` is omitted, the daemon automatically searches for Edge, Brave, and Google Chrome in common system paths.

## API Documentation

### 1. Scrape HLS Stream (`POST /scrape/hls`)
Recommended for extracting and validating playable HLS streams. It automatically uses an Android Chrome User-Agent, triggers theTurnstile solver, clicks standard play buttons, intercepts the media requests, and validates manifest playability.

#### Request Body
- `url` (string, required): The URL of the video streaming web page.
- `wait_ms` (int, optional): Duration in milliseconds to wait after the page completes loading (max 15000ms).
- `local_storage` (map[string]string, optional): Local storage keys and values to inject before loading the page.
- `headers` (map[string]string, optional): Key-value pairs of request headers to apply.

```json
{
  "url": "https://example-streaming-site.com/video/123",
  "wait_ms": 3000,
  "local_storage": {
    "auth_token": "xyz789"
  },
  "headers": {
    "Referer": "https://referrer.com/"
  }
}
```

#### Response Body (Success)
- `playable_url` (string): The resolved and validated `.m3u8` playlist URL.
- `qualities` (array): A list of parsed resolutions and stream links found inside the master manifest.
- `headers` (map[string]string): The HTTP headers captured with the `.m3u8` request, necessary to play the stream (e.g., `User-Agent`, `Referer`, `Origin`).

```json
{
  "playable_url": "https://cdn.example.com/playlist.m3u8",
  "qualities": [
    {
      "quality": "1920x1080",
      "url": "https://cdn.example.com/1080p.m3u8",
      "headers": {
        "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
        "Referer": "https://example-streaming-site.com/"
      }
    },
    {
      "quality": "1280x720",
      "url": "https://cdn.example.com/720p.m3u8",
      "headers": {
        "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
        "Referer": "https://example-streaming-site.com/"
      }
    }
  ],
  "headers": {
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
    "Referer": "https://example-streaming-site.com/"
  }
}
```

#### Response Body (Failure / Error)
```json
{
  "error": "Found HLS links but none were playable"
}
```

### 2. General Scrape Execution (`POST /execute`)
Runs general-purpose page scraping. Navigates, executes custom browser actions, collects all resource URLs, extracts page content, and captures HLS requests.

#### Request Body
- `url` (string, required): Target URL.
- `wait_ms` (int, optional): Duration to wait in milliseconds (max 15000ms).
- `headers` (map[string]string, optional): Request headers.
- `local_storage` (map[string]string, optional): Local storage items.
- `debug` (bool, optional): Include all intercepted network requests.
- `include_headers` (bool, optional): Probe and include captured request headers.
- `stream` (bool, optional): Return an NDJSON stream of events.
- `actions` (array, optional): Custom actions to run sequentially. Available types:
  - `wait` or `sleep` (wait_ms)
  - `wait_ready` (selector, wait_ms)
  - `click` or `double_click` (selector, or x/y)
  - `scroll` (delta_x, delta_y)
  - `type` or `send_keys` (selector, text)
  - `evaluate` or `eval` (script)
